# Three pages

App consists of three pages:
* Home page — two large buttons/links to other pages
* Data page — long list of comments fetched from online JSON dummy generator. Comments are displayed as a list of cards
* Stats page — page is divided into two parts. Bottom part – a preview of data page which renders is measured. The top part display performance data, i.e. time spent on comments fetching and web vitals.

  DISCLAIMER: I am not familiar with profiling/measuring performance in React. I googled this topic but found nothing about how to measure and use data of profiler

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
